An [Agent Plugins 1.0.0](https://agent-plugins.org/) client extension for the [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev/).

This is a community-maintained client implementation, not an official release of the Agent Plugins specification project.

It lets Pi load portable plugin directories containing:

- **Agent Skills** from immediate `skills/*/SKILL.md` children
- **MCP servers** from root `mcp.json`, using [`pi-mcp-adapter`](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter) as the MCP runtime
- Optional Pi-specific resources — prompts, themes, and trusted in-process hooks — under the `dev.pi.agent` client-extension namespace

The loader implements the spec's closed schemas, filesystem containment, narrow component failure boundaries, plugin-variable expansion, persistent `PLUGIN_DATA`, and transport rules.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Pi 0.84+
- `pi-mcp-adapter` for MCP support

## Install

Install both required Pi packages. `pi-mcp-adapter` is the MCP runtime used by this extension and must be installed for plugin MCP servers to work:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
pi install npm:pi-agent-plugins
```

Installing only `pi-agent-plugins` enables portable skill discovery, but MCP servers remain unavailable until `pi-mcp-adapter` is installed.

Or install this package from GitHub after installing the same MCP requirement:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
pi install https://github.com/BlockedPath/pi-agent-plugins
```

From a local checkout:

```bash
npm install
npm test
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
pi install /path/to/pi-agent-plugins
```

For a one-off development run:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/pi-agent-plugins/extensions/index.ts
```

## Plugin locations

The extension discovers immediate child directories containing `plugin.json`:

| Scope | Location | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User | `~/.pi/agent/plugins/<plugin>/plugin.json` | Available in all projects |
| Project | `<project>/.pi/plugins/<plugin>/plugin.json` | Loaded only after Pi trusts the project |

User and project plugins with the same manifest `name` are deduplicated; the project copy wins in that project.

Persistent state is kept outside package contents:

- `~/.pi/agent/plugin-data/<plugin>/` — user-plugin `PLUGIN_DATA`
- `~/.pi/agent/plugin-data/project/<plugin>-<instance>/` — project-plugin `PLUGIN_DATA`, isolated by resolved install root
- `~/.pi/agent/agent-plugins/state.json` — enablement and MCP trust decisions
- `~/.pi/agent/agent-plugins/managed-mcp.json` — user MCP projection ledger
- `<project>/.pi/agent-plugins-managed-mcp.json` — project MCP projection ledger

## Commands

```text
/plugin list
/plugin info <name>
/plugin install <source>
/plugin uninstall <name>
/plugin enable <name>
/plugin disable <name>
/plugin trust <name>
/plugin reload
/plugin doctor
```

Install sources:

```bash
/plugin install npm:@acme/tools@1.2.3
/plugin install github.com/acme/tools@v1.2.3
/plugin install https://github.com/acme/tools.git
/plugin install git:git@github.com:acme/tools.git@v1.2.3
/plugin install ./local-plugin
```

npm downloads use `npm pack --ignore-scripts`; package lifecycle scripts are not executed during installation. Git uses a shallow, non-interactive clone. Every source is staged and its root manifest is validated before it reaches the install directory.

`/plugin reload` reconciles MCP configuration, then invokes Pi's normal reload flow so skills and MCP runtime state refresh together.

## MCP trust model

A plugin can launch a process with the user's permissions. Discovery and validation therefore do **not** automatically activate MCP servers.

The extension asks for explicit trust once per installed plugin instance. A trusted user plugin never transfers trust or `PLUGIN_DATA` to a project plugin that reuses its manifest name. You can also run:

```bash
/plugin trust <name>
```

The trust command writes the projection and reloads Pi automatically. If trust was granted through the startup confirmation prompt instead, run `/reload` once.

Disabling or uninstalling a plugin removes only MCP entries recorded in the extension's managed ledger. User-authored MCP entries are preserved. An unreadable existing MCP config is never overwritten.

Project MCP servers are projected into `<project>/.pi/mcp.json`, not the global config, so they cannot leak into another working directory. User plugin servers are projected into `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`.

## Portable plugin example

```text
hello-plugin/
├── plugin.json
├── skills/
│   └── greet/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── mcp.json
```

`plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "hello-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Greeting skill and tools"
}
```

`skills/greet/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: greet
description: Greet the user and offer help. Use when the user asks for a greeting.
---

Greet the user warmly and offer help.
```

`mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/mcp.schema.json",
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-tools": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "./bin/server",
      "args": ["--data", "${PLUGIN_DATA}"],
      "env": {
        "CONFIG": "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"
      },
      "cwd": "${PLUGIN_ROOT}"
    },
    "remote-tools": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://tools.example.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Projected MCP server names are namespaced to avoid collisions:

```text
hello-plugin__local-tools
hello-plugin__remote-tools
```

MCP tools retain pi-mcp-adapter's normal tool naming, approval, OAuth, resource, prompt, tracing, and lifecycle behavior.

## Pi client extension namespace

Portable components remain in the fixed standard locations. Pi-only additions can be declared under `extensions["dev.pi.agent"]`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "pi-enhanced-plugin",
  "extensions": {
    "dev.pi.agent": {
      "prompts": ["./prompts"],
      "themes": ["./themes"]
    }
  }
}
```

All declared paths must begin with `./` and remain within the filesystem-resolved plugin root. Other extension namespaces are ignored without validation, as required by Agent Plugins §8.1.

## Pi hooks

`extensions["dev.pi.agent"].hooks` lets a plugin declare in-process Pi hook modules:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "pi-enhanced-plugin",
  "extensions": {
    "dev.pi.agent": {
      "hooks": ["./dev.pi.agent/hooks.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Each declared path must begin with `./`, resolve to a contained `.ts`, `.js`, `.mjs`, or `.cjs` file, and export a default function matching:

```ts
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

interface AgentPluginContext {
  pluginName: string;
  pluginRoot: string;
  pluginData: string;
  scope: "user" | "project";
  manifest: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>;
}

export default (pi: ExtensionAPI, ctx: AgentPluginContext) => {
  pi.on("tool_call", (event) => {
    // ...
  });
};
```

`dev.pi.agent.hooks` are **Pi client hooks**: focused, in-process modules loaded through this client, distinct from the wider Agent Plugins ecosystem's declarative `hooks.json` convention. Other Agent Plugins clients are free to ignore this field.

Hooks require explicit `pi-entrypoints` trust (separate from `mcp` trust) and run **in-process with the user's own permissions** — once trusted, a hook can do anything the user's Pi session can do. Only trust plugins whose hook source you have reviewed.

Because hooks are Pi-specific client policy, portable skills bundled in the same plugin cannot rely on `${PLUGIN_DATA}` expansion; that placeholder is only guaranteed for stdio MCP subprocess `args`, `env`, and `cwd`. A hook receives its data directory directly as `ctx.pluginData`.

## Transport support

| Transport | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stdio` | Supported | Bare command or contained `./` executable; arguments are always separate |
| `streamable-http` | Supported without configured headers or adapter-sensitive environment syntax | OAuth remains client-managed by pi-mcp-adapter |
| legacy `sse` | Not supported | Optional in Agent Plugins 1.0.0; skipped with a diagnostic |

Legacy `sse` is deliberately skipped. Agent Plugins requires the declared transport for the **initial** connection attempt, while pi-mcp-adapter's URL connector begins with Streamable HTTP and only falls back to SSE for backwards compatibility. Treating an explicit `sse` entry as a generic URL would be non-conformant.

Remote entries with configured `headers` are also skipped. Agent Plugins prohibits forwarding those headers to a different origin through redirects. The installed MCP runtime does not expose a redirect-policy hook, and Node forwards custom headers across cross-origin redirects. Refusing the entry is safer than leaking package data.

Headerless Streamable HTTP URLs containing `${NAME}`, `$env:NAME`, or `{env:NAME}` syntax are skipped as well. pi-mcp-adapter would expand those otherwise-valid URL strings using its host environment, which Agent Plugins §9.2 forbids. Other headerless Streamable HTTP endpoints remain supported.

## Security and containment

- `plugin.json`, fixed component locations, discovered `SKILL.md`, bundled commands, and Pi-extension paths must remain inside the filesystem-resolved plugin root.
- Symlink, junction, and traversal escapes are rejected at the narrowest applicable failure boundary.
- `command` is one token. It is never shell-parsed or placeholder-expanded.
- Only `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${PLUGIN_DATA}` are expanded, once, in stdio `args`, `env` values, and `cwd`.
- Stdio servers launch through a bundled client-owned shim so pi-mcp-adapter cannot reinterpret `${HOME}`, `$env:HOME`, `{env:HOME}`, or leading-`!` strings as native secret expressions or shell commands.
- Plugin config cannot set the reserved `PLUGIN_ROOT` or `PLUGIN_DATA` environment names; the launcher applies platform environment-name semantics before setting them.
- Non-loopback HTTP MCP endpoints must use HTTPS.
- Configured remote headers are validated as literal package data, but header-bearing servers are not activated until the MCP runtime can enforce cross-origin redirect isolation.

Review third-party plugin source before installing it. Skills can instruct the model to execute code, and trusted MCP servers run with the user's permissions. Agent Plugins v1 defines no signature, attestation, sandbox, permission-declaration, portable secret, audit-event, or plugin-dependency standard; this client does not imply those guarantees.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

The test suite covers manifest and MCP failure boundaries, strict Agent Skills validation, path/symlink containment, placeholder semantics, MCP projection, managed-config preservation, transport handling, and install-source parsing.
