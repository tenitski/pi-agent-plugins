| MCP runtime | [`pi-mcp-adapter`](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter) |

This is a community-maintained Agent Plugins client for Pi, not an official release of the Agent Plugins specification project.

## Purpose

`pi-agent-plugins` lets Pi discover, validate, install, trust, and manage portable Agent Plugins. A portable plugin can provide:

- Agent Skills at immediate `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directories
- MCP servers from root `mcp.json`
- optional Pi-specific prompts, themes, and trusted in-process hooks through `extensions["dev.pi.agent"]`

Plugin sources can come from npm, Git, or local directories.

## Installation

Both Pi packages are required for skill and MCP support:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
pi install npm:pi-agent-plugins
```

Installing only `pi-agent-plugins` enables portable skill discovery, but plugin MCP servers require `pi-mcp-adapter`.

## User workflow

```text
/plugin list
/plugin install <source>
/plugin info <name>
/plugin trust <name>
/plugin enable <name>
/plugin disable <name>
/plugin uninstall <name>
/plugin reload
/plugin doctor
```

Example:

```text
/plugin install github.com/example/my-plugin
/plugin trust my-plugin
```

`/plugin trust` grants one installed plugin instance permission to activate its MCP servers and then reloads Pi.

## Portable plugin layout

```text
example-plugin/
├── plugin.json
├── skills/
│   └── example-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── mcp.json
```

Minimal `plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "example-plugin"
}
```

Minimal `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/mcp.schema.json",
  "mcpServers": {
    "tools": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${PLUGIN_ROOT}/server.mjs"],
      "cwd": "${PLUGIN_ROOT}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Discovery and persistent state

| Scope | Plugin location |
| --- | --- |
| User | `~/.pi/agent/plugins/<plugin>/plugin.json` |
| Trusted project | `<project>/.pi/plugins/<plugin>/plugin.json` |

Persistent client state:

- `~/.pi/agent/plugin-data/<plugin>/` — user-plugin `PLUGIN_DATA`
- `~/.pi/agent/plugin-data/project/<plugin>-<instance>/` — isolated project-plugin data
- `~/.pi/agent/agent-plugins/state.json` — enablement and trust
- `~/.pi/agent/agent-plugins/managed-mcp.json` — user projection ledger
- `<project>/.pi/agent-plugins-managed-mcp.json` — project projection ledger

Project and user plugins that reuse a manifest name do not share trust or writable data.

## Architecture map

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `extensions/index.ts` | Pi extension entry point, resource discovery, trust prompt, and `/plugin` registration |
| `src/runtime.ts` | Runtime registry, user/project scanning, trust, and synchronization |
| `src/loader.ts` | Plugin and component discovery with failure boundaries |
| `src/manifest.ts` | Closed `plugin.json` validation |
| `src/skill.ts` | Agent Skills frontmatter validation |
| `src/mcp-config.ts` | Closed `mcp.json` and per-server validation |
| `src/mcp-runtime.ts` | Runtime compatibility, transport, command, and cwd checks |
| `src/mcp-bridge.ts` | Projection into pi-mcp-adapter configuration and managed reconciliation |
| `bin/stdio-launcher.mjs` | Literal-safe stdio launch and platform-correct environment overlay |
| `src/paths.ts` | Placeholder expansion and filesystem-resolved containment |
| `src/paths-client.ts` | User/project paths and per-instance `PLUGIN_DATA` |
| `src/install.ts` | npm, Git, local staging, validation, install, and uninstall |
| `src/plugin-command.ts` | `/plugin` command implementation |
| `CONFORMANCE.md` | Requirement-by-requirement standards map and known limitations |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release history |
| `RELEASING.md` | npm trusted-publishing and tagging procedure |

## Security and conformance decisions

- The canonical schemas are selected locally; they are not fetched while loading a plugin.
- Unknown root manifest fields are reported and ignored as required; other manifest schema failures reject the plugin.
- Filesystem-resolved containment rejects traversal, symlink, junction, and equivalent escapes at the narrowest required boundary.
- Skills are discovered only from immediate children of `skills/`.
- MCP entries are validated independently so one bad server does not disable valid siblings or skills.
- MCP execution requires explicit client-owned trust.
- Managed MCP reconciliation preserves user-authored pi-mcp-adapter configuration.
- `PLUGIN_ROOT` and `PLUGIN_DATA` are supplied by the client and cannot be overridden by plugin configuration.
- Placeholder expansion is single-pass and limited to `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${PLUGIN_DATA}` in stdio `args`, env values, and `cwd`.
- A client-owned stdio launcher prevents pi-mcp-adapter from reinterpreting `${HOME}`, `$env:HOME`, `{env:HOME}`, or leading-`!` values.
- Environment overlay uses case-insensitive key equivalence on Windows and exact equivalence elsewhere.
- MCP server names use injective encoding so arbitrary JSON keys cannot collide.
- Null-prototype maps preserve special JSON keys such as `__proto__`.

## MCP transport profile

| Transport | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `stdio` | Supported |
| Headerless Streamable HTTP | Supported when the URL can remain literal |
| Streamable HTTP with configured headers | Skipped because cross-origin redirect header isolation cannot be enforced |
| URL containing `${NAME}`, `$env:NAME`, or `{env:NAME}` | Skipped because pi-mcp-adapter would expand it |
| Legacy HTTP+SSE | Unsupported and skipped |

OAuth discovery, interaction, approval, credential storage, tracing, and MCP lifecycle handling remain delegated to pi-mcp-adapter.

## Known standard boundaries

Agent Plugins v1 does not standardize:

- signatures or provenance attestations
- sandboxing or permission declarations
- portable secrets
- enterprise policy
- audit-event schemas
- dependencies between plugins
- a plugin test harness

The trust and management features in this project are Pi client policy, not portable manifest fields.

The Agent Skills website describes skill names as lowercase `a-z`, `0-9`, and hyphens, matching Pi. The current `skills-ref` implementation also accepts normalized Unicode names. This client follows the published textual constraint until the specification and host converge.

## Validation baseline

The `0.1.1` release was verified with:

- TypeScript typecheck
- 29 passing Node tests
- Knip checks
- npm package dry run containing the launcher, gallery image, and changelog
- LSP and security diagnostics
- the official MCP everything server through the projected stdio launcher
- expected MCP tools including `echo` and `get-sum`

Development commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Release process

Normal release flow:

1. Update `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Run typecheck, tests, and package dry run.
3. Commit and push to `main`.
4. Configure npm trusted publishing for `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
5. Create and push the matching `v<version>` tag.
6. Verify npm, GitHub release, Pi gallery metadata, and installation from npm.

If GitHub Actions is unavailable, publish manually:

```bash
npm publish --access public
gh release create vX.Y.Z --verify-tag --generate-notes
```

Always confirm that the release tag points to the final tested commit before publishing. npm versions are immutable.

## Short showcase description
