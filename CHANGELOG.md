# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add trusted Pi hooks via `extensions["dev.pi.agent"].hooks`: in-process hook
  modules loaded through Jiti, gated by capability-aware trust (`mcp` and
  `pi-entrypoints` are granted and revoked independently) with install-generation
  code-identity invalidation so replaced package code loses `pi-entrypoints`
  trust until re-reviewed and re-trusted.
- Surface hooks in `/plugin info`, `/plugin trust`, and `/plugin doctor`, and
  prompt separately for `Pi hook:` and `MCP server:` capabilities on first use.

## 0.1.8

- Release from the self-hosted Windows runner using an `NPM_TOKEN` secret
  (OIDC trusted publishing and Sigstore provenance were unreliable there).
- Keep Windows `npm pack` and path-normalization fixes from 0.1.7.

## 0.1.7

- Fix Windows `npm pack` install by invoking `node npm-cli.js` (or `npm.cmd`)
  instead of bare `npm` under `execFile`.
- Normalize `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` / `${PLUGIN_DATA}` cwd resolution so mixed path
  separators do not break containment checks on Windows.
- Normalize path equality assertions in the paths loader tests for Windows.

## 0.1.6

- Render the cleaned badge group as one physical Markdown line because Pi.dev strips raw HTML from package READMEs.
- Add a top-level README heading.

## 0.1.5

- Add the security policy to the published package documentation.
- Remove CodeRabbit, npm-download, and Bundlephobia badges whose upstream providers returned errors.
- Render the remaining badges as one inline HTML group for consistent horizontal layout across GitHub, npm, and Pi.dev.

## 0.1.4

- Add a Contributor Covenant code of conduct and contribution guidelines.
- Add structured bug-report and feature-request forms.
- Add a pull-request template with validation and compatibility checks.

## 0.1.3

- Add Last Commit, Issues, and Conventional Commits badges to the README.

## 0.1.2

- Remove the duplicated badge block from the README rendered on npm.
- Add `PROJECT_REFERENCE.md` as a durable architecture, operations, conformance, and release reference.

## 0.1.1

- Preserve portable stdio `args`, `env`, and `cwd` semantics through a client-owned launcher instead of exposing plugin values to pi-mcp-adapter interpolation and secret-command handling.
- Skip remote URLs whose literal value pi-mcp-adapter cannot preserve.
- Apply semantic path and runtime-support filtering during plugin discovery.
- Make qualified MCP server names injective for arbitrary JSON member names.
- Preserve special JSON object keys such as `__proto__` during validation.
- Reject unknown Agent Skills frontmatter fields and whitespace-only descriptions.
- Apply platform environment-name semantics, including case-insensitive replacement on Windows.
- Update conformance documentation for the Published v1.0.0 specification and its non-normative future considerations.

## 0.1.0

- Initial Agent Plugins 1.0.0 client release for Pi.
