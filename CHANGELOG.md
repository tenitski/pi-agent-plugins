# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add `owner/repo[:subdir][@ref]` GitHub shorthand to `/plugin install`,
  installing a plugin from a subdirectory of a repository. The selected
  directory is resolved with filesystem containment checks after clone, and
  only that directory is copied into the install root. This is client
  installation policy, not Agent Plugins 1.0 conformance.

## 0.1.8

- Release from the self-hosted Windows runner using an `NPM_TOKEN` secret
  (OIDC trusted publishing and Sigstore provenance were unreliable there).
- Keep Windows `npm pack` and path-normalization fixes from 0.1.7.

## 0.1.7

- Fix Windows `npm pack` install by invoking `node npm-cli.js` (or `npm.cmd`)
  instead of bare `npm` under `execFile`.
- Normalize `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` / `${PLUGIN_DATA}` cwd resolution so mixed path
  separators do not break containment checks on Windows.
- Normalize path equality assertions in the paths loader tests for Windows.

## 0.1.6

- Render the cleaned badge group as one physical Markdown line because Pi.dev strips raw HTML from package READMEs.
- Add a top-level README heading.

## 0.1.5

- Add the security policy to the published package documentation.
- Remove CodeRabbit, npm-download, and Bundlephobia badges whose upstream providers returned errors.
- Render the remaining badges as one inline HTML group for consistent horizontal layout across GitHub, npm, and Pi.dev.

## 0.1.4

- Add a Contributor Covenant code of conduct and contribution guidelines.
- Add structured bug-report and feature-request forms.
- Add a pull-request template with validation and compatibility checks.

## 0.1.3

- Add Last Commit, Issues, and Conventional Commits badges to the README.

## 0.1.2

- Remove the duplicated badge block from the README rendered on npm.
- Add `PROJECT_REFERENCE.md` as a durable architecture, operations, conformance, and release reference.

## 0.1.1

- Preserve portable stdio `args`, `env`, and `cwd` semantics through a client-owned launcher instead of exposing plugin values to pi-mcp-adapter interpolation and secret-command handling.
- Skip remote URLs whose literal value pi-mcp-adapter cannot preserve.
- Apply semantic path and runtime-support filtering during plugin discovery.
- Make qualified MCP server names injective for arbitrary JSON member names.
- Preserve special JSON object keys such as `__proto__` during validation.
- Reject unknown Agent Skills frontmatter fields and whitespace-only descriptions.
- Apply platform environment-name semantics, including case-insensitive replacement on Windows.
- Update conformance documentation for the Published v1.0.0 specification and its non-normative future considerations.

## 0.1.0

- Initial Agent Plugins 1.0.0 client release for Pi.
